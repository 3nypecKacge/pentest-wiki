***Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers*** is an American animated adventure comedy television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation.[1] Created by Tad Stones and Alan Zaslove, it featured established Disney characters Chip 'n' Dale in a new setting. The series premiered on The Disney Channel on March 4, 1989,[2] after the episode "Catteries Not Included" aired on August 27, 1988, as a preview.[3] The series continued in September with a two-hour special, *Rescue Rangers: To the Rescue*, later divided into five parts to air as part of the weekday run.[4] The final episode aired on November 19, 1990.
 
On September 18, 1989, the series entered national syndication. It often aired afternoons along with and following *DuckTales* and later *TaleSpin*. From 1990 to 1993, reruns were aired as a part of The Disney Afternoon.[2] It was shown on Toon Disney upon that channel's launch in 1998 but was removed a decade later. The entire run became available (as one season) as part of Disney+ as of its launch on November 12, 2019, fully remastered in high definition.[5] The series was initially released on Blu-ray on January 25, 2022, via Disney Movie Club, then everywhere else on February 15, 2022.[6]

Chip and Dale are two chipmunks who start a detective agency, Rescue Rangers, along with their friends Gadget Hackwrench, Monterey Jack, and Zipper. The pint-sized detectives deal with crimes that are often "too small" for the police to handle, usually with other animals as their clients.[7] The gang frequently find themselves going up against two particular arch-villains: Mafia-style tabby cat Fat Cat and mad scientist Norton Nimnul.
 
Except for the five-part set of episodes made from the pilot movie, each 22-minute episode of the series was self-contained. Plot points introduced in each episode stayed in the episode and any character development didn't appear to continue through to future episodes. Most of the episodes followed a similar format, wherein the next case was presented at the start of the episode, then the bulk of the episode had the sleuths gathering clues and investigating the situation. In the last few minutes of the episode, the case was resolved, usually in dramatic fashion and the final moments would have a humorous wrap-up scene between the Rangers.
 
*Rescue Rangers* was originally conceived as the first of three new companion shows to Disney's popular *DuckTales* series, which had more than doubled the ratings among child audiences in its time slots after its debut in the fall of 1987.[17] Disney had originally invested $20 million in *DuckTales* and then invested $28 million in *Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers*.[18]
 
It, along with *TaleSpin* and a third series, *Double-O Duck* (which ultimately became *Darkwing Duck*),[19] would round out a programming block later known as "The Disney Afternoon" along with the previously established *Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears* to capitalize on *DuckTales*'s success.[17]
 
When Tad Stones first came up with the idea for the *Rescue Rangers* series, Chip and Dale were not part of the show. He initially pitched doing a TV series based on *The Rescuers*, but Disney rejected that idea as a sequel to that film was already in production. He created a new concept with the working title of *Metro Mice*. The original draft starred an Indiana Jones-type mouse named Kit Colby who sported a fedora and a fluffy collared leather jacket, and the rest of the team included a chameleon, an earlier version of Gadget and a character resembling Monterey Jack with a different name. When he proposed the show in a meeting with Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the idea was well received except for the character of Kit. At Eisner's suggestion, they replaced him with the chipmunk duo to give the show some established Disney characters to work with.[9] By late 1987, two years before its television debut, the show was announced under its original proposed title of "*Chip 'n Dale and the Rescue Rangers*".[20]

The series premiered in 1989 on The Disney Channel before moving into a regular slot in syndication the following fall. In 1990, the series premiered as part of the lineup known as The Disney Afternoon, where it ran until 1993.[4][8] On October 2, 1995, *Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers* began reruns on The Disney Channel as part of a two-hour programming block called "Block Party", airing weekdays in the late afternoon/early evening and which also included *Darkwing Duck*, *TaleSpin* and *DuckTales*.[21]
 
The show's opening theme was written (listed in the end credits as "words & music") by Mark Mueller, an ASCAP Award-winning pop music songwriter who also wrote the popular *DuckTales* theme song, and produced by Alf Clausen. The song performed over the title credits is sung by Jeff Pescetto (who also performed the *DuckTales* theme song). A full-length theme song was recorded by The Jets, a Minnesota pop group, and released on The Disney Afternoon soundtrack.
 
Additionally, on October 1, 1993, the episode "Ghost of a Chance" was released together with the *Goof Troop* episode "Hallow-Weenies" on one VHS cassette as a special release called *Boo-Busters*[22][23] and the episode "Good Times, Bat Times" was released together with the *Darkwing Duck* episode "Ghoul of My Dreams" on one VHS cassette as a special release called *Witcheroo!*[24][25]
 
In the United Kingdom, Disney released one Region 2 volume in 2007, titled *Chip 'n Dale - Rescue Rangers - First Collection*.[29] Despite the set being similar to the US version, it contained only 20 episodes, while having 6 language tracks: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish and Dutch. Several other similar releases were then made to other countries, but only going up to episode #20. On December 5, 2012, a second DVD set of the series was released in the UK, but as a Region 2 version of Volume 2, titled *Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Season 2*.[30] Unlike the first DVD set, this 3-disc set includes a Fastplay mode and only two language tracks: English and German, but subtitles have not been added. As of yet, there are no announced plans to release the rest of the series, or the seven episodes missing between the first two sets.
 
The series was released on Amazon Video in 2013 and was free for Amazon Prime members.[31] However, it was unavailable for some time. The series was brought back to Amazon Instant Video in the United States in 2016, being currently available for purchase in SD and HD.
 
The complete series was released alongside the release of Disney's streaming service Disney+ on November 12, 2019.[5] There, it is cropped to 16:9 widescreen format, unlike the Blu-ray release (which retains its original aspect ratio).
 
Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has released the entire series on Blu-ray Disc in a 2022 multi-region, high definition six-disc set, keeping its original image ratio (1.33:1). All episodes have been scanned from the original negatives, except episode 32 of season 2 "Prehysterical Pet" whose negatives could not be located. They are not sorted in the original airing order, nor the intended chronological order (e.g., the pilot episodes "Rescue Rangers to the Rescue - parts 1-5" are on disc 4).
 
Hal Erickson of *Television Cartoon Shows, An Illustrated Encyclopedia* compared the show to *DuckTales*, stating that it was "consummately produced and written," and its animation "succeeded in putting most other overseas output to shame."[32] Emily Ashby of *Common Sense Media* rated the series 4 out of 5 stars, complimented the depiction of positive messages, citing teamwork and saying the series succeeds to depict a female character as a role model, while finding the show family-friendly and entertaining.[33] *IGN* named *Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers* as the 60th-best in the Top 100 Animated TV Shows.[34] Jeremy Hayes of *BuzzFeed* ranked *Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers* 4th in their "Best Cartoons From The '80s" list.[35] Tyler B. Searle of *Collider* included in their "10 Best Animated Disney Channel Shows" list.[36]
 
In fall of 1989, McDonald's produced a series of *Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers* themed Happy Meal that included toy versions of the main characters riding small vehicles. Scenes from the series were incorporated into the TV commercials advertising the Happy Meals. Ice cream versions of Chip 'n Dale were made by Good Humor.
 
A monthly comic book based on the show was published by Disney Comics in 1990, that ran for 19 issues. Subsequent comic stories were printed in *Disney Adventures* from 1990 to 1995, as well as in the Disney Afternoon comic book published by Marvel Comics. They also had a series from Boom Studios that was published for 8 issues from December 2010 to June 2011.
 
From September 2010, *Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers* was revived by comics publisher Boom! Studios, as an ongoing monthly series slated to begin in December of the same year. This choice was based on the extreme and unexpected popularity of *Darkwing Duck*, another Disney Afternoon property which BOOM! revived earlier in 2010. The series featured comics writer Ian Brill, and artist Leonel Castellani.[47][48][49][50]
 
A live-action CGI feature-length film[53] directed by Akiva Schaffer; written by Dan Gregor and Doug Mand; produced by David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman;[54] and starring John Mulaney and Andy Samberg as the voices of Chip and Dale was released on May 20, 2022, on Disney+.[55] The film also stars Eric Bana and Dennis Haysbert as the voices of Monterey Jack and Zipper while both Tress MacNeille and Corey Burton reprise their roles of Gadget and Zipper as well as Chip and Dale for a brief scene.[56][57][58]
